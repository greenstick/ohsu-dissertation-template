# OHSU Dissertation Template

This project is designed to serve as a dissertation template following the guidelines of the School of Medicine at Oregon Health & Science University. 

## Usage

I recommend cloning this project into Overleaf. It's free for individual users, and $15 a month if you'd like to include collaborators. This template is also available in Overleaf's template library. 

## Contributing

As I write this, I'm in the last year of my PhD at OHSU. It's possible that once I finish that the style guidance will change (or be improved!) Pull requests and issues that help maintain alignment with the published style guide for OHSU School of Medicine will be included and be much appreciated! Further, if your department of school has more specific guidance, branches are encouraged!

## How Can I Say Thank You?

No need! Although, if you did find this helpful and feel like you have change to spare, here's one way you can show your appreciation!
